# ColourChange

ColorChange is a reaction based game where by the player must react to a changing background colour.

The player is a square in the middle of the screen which can be one of three colours (red, green or blue) and by pressing any key on the keyboard the player can change the colour of the square.

The player must match the colour of the square to the background colour the square is on. Colours can be changed when the square is on top of a black bar. The black bars move in from the right hand side of the screen and move towards the left.

As time passes the speed of the black bars increases, making the game more difficult.

The aim of the game is to get the highest score possible. Score is time based and when the player loses this score gets saved to a text file to be used in the next game.

Main features include file reading and writing, collision detection and general game design with a polling like architecture.
